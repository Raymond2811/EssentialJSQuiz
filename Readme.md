# <EssentialJSQuize>

## Description

I built this website to help people understand a little bit about JavaScript. When building this website, one thing I learned attention to detail required in managing the timer, especially when implementing features like subtracting 10 seconds for a wrong answer or handling data persistence through local storage. 

## Usage

This website is simple to use. You just click start quiz, and you?re presented a couple questions, and you?re timed. After you finish the quiz, simply type your initials and click submit.
