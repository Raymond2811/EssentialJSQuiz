# EssentialJSQuiz

## Description

I built this JavaScript quiz application to test users' knowledge and challenge their JavaScript skills. When building this website, one thing I learned attention to detail required in managing the timer, especially when implementing features like subtracting 10 seconds for a wrong answer or handling data persistence through local storage.
